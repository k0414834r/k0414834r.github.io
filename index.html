		<h1> Quick Introduction
			<p>
			Hello! This is my second time attempt at a website. The first time was for a freshman computer science elective in college. I graduated with the class of 2017 from Trinity College, CT, with a BS in neuroscience. Neuroscience has been my passion since high school; however, I have come to realize that I would prefer applications outside of a laboratory setting. Recently, technologies like virtual reality (VR) and brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have caught my interest. I realized I must embrace the world of code if I wish to pursue those interests. That is how I made my way here today...
